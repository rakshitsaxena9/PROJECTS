Priority of this design was to keep the cart as light weight as possible and rigid with good performance on grassy and concrete terrain used in either golf course or in hospitality, education sectors. A unique tubular chassis is created in the design comprising of circular & rectangular shape. The focus of design was long mileage from the batteries used and how much addition of solar panels can contribute to the existing range of the electric vehicle.

The rate of reaction is controlled by turbulent mixing, after which mass fractions of different species are captured including Nox emmisions & soot formation & plotted for different locations in the model.  n A parametric study is created for the second part where the effect of addition of water content in the fuel from 5% to 30% is observed on the formation of Nox and soot. It is verified that the results of this project match the experimental expectations of reducing the formation of Nox and Soot by addition of water, and how different amount of it affects the model., url: https://skill-lync.com/projects/Combustion-Simulation-and-the-effect-of-the-addition-of-water-content-on-the-formation-of-Nox-and-soot-66732\n\n Volunteer_work: starts_at: None, ends_at: None, title: Fundraising volunteer, cause: Children, company: CRY - Child Rights and You, company_linkedin_profile_url: https://in.linkedin.com/company/cry, description: Volunteered in fundraising for CRY., logo_url: https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGTlcSPlGiCmQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1606829898256?e=1655337600&v=beta&t=vQClgQVdkhB-882ZcTRi3aaTUAyInzwrD7NoxVwT9eg\n\n Certifications: starts_at: day: 1, month: 7, year: 2020, ends_at: None, name: EFSET English Certificate 82/100 - C2 Proficient, license_number: None, display_source: www.efset.org, authority: EF Standard English Test (EF SET), url: http://www.efset.org/cert/VMVCsD, starts_at: day: 1, month: 4, year: 2020, ends_at: None, name: Advanced CFD using Ansys Fluent, license_number: qQGZoUUHKtNiHQD2, display_source: s3.amazonaws.com, authority: Skill-Lync, url: https://s3.amazonaws.com/skill-lync-certificate-files/aadilshaikh-completion-certificate-qQGZoUUHKtNiHQD2.jpg, starts_at: day: 1, month: 7, year: 2019, ends_at: None, name: Matlab for Mechanical Engineers, license_number: 6lpgGMjFH8hTQ6uZ, display_source: s3.amazonaws.com, authority: Skill-Lync, url: https://s3.amazonaws.com/skill-lync-certificate-files/aadilshaikh-completion-certificate-6lpgGMjFH8hTQ6uZ.jpg, starts_at: day: 1, month: 4, year: 2019, ends_at: None, name: Associate-Additive Manufacturing, license_number: C-KFHZS3GYP6, display_source: 1drv.ms, authority: Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, url: https://1drv.ms/b/s!AtsmRtipj9AHgRmGWdlG0Y4-oymI\n\n Similarly_named_profiles: name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://in.linkedin.com/in/aadil-shaikh-2a0596106, summary: 10k+ Connections|Mechanical Engineer|Production|QA|Product advertisement |Business Strategist|Freelance jobs|Medical Device |Freelancer, location: Gujarat, India, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://in.linkedin.com/in/aadil-shaikh5, summary: University Hire - Process Engineering || Bechtel India || Keen to attain threshold in diverse domain || MSU-FTE, location: Vadodara, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://in.linkedin.com/in/aadil-shaikh-6b1047209, summary: Graduate | Business Management | Financial Analyst | Accountant, location: Mumbai, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://ae.linkedin.com/in/aadilshaikh, summary: Senior Business Manager | Amazon | Sony | Asus | E-commerce | Product & Program Management | Coaching & Development, location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://in.linkedin.com/in/aadil-shaikh-a0957356, summary: Senior QA Analyst at GEP Worldwide, location: Thane, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://in.linkedin.com/in/aadil-shaikh-ba198422b, summary: Lead Generator | IT Sales | BDE, location: Vadodara, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://ca.linkedin.com/in/aadilshaikh22, summary: Actively looking for Summer\u201922 Interships | Masters Of Applied Computer Science, Dalhousie University \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 | Former Programmer Analyst at Cognizant | Intern at D-Link, location: Halifax, NS, name: Aadil Shaikh, link: https://in.linkedin.com/in/aadil-shaikh-41581b118, summary: Team Coordinator At Aqkode Healthcare Solution Pvt Ltd, location: Ahmedabad\n\n Inferred_salary: min: None, max: None\n\n Gender: None\n\n Birth_date: None\n\n Industry: None\n\n "}, {"role": "model", "content": "I am a Mechanical Engineer with keen interest in CFD & Design.

When the product price is changed they need to update each excel file. There is no option to find and print the previously saved invoice or their payment list. There is no security; anybody can access any report and sensitive data. nnThe project was to create a platform for keeping day by day tally records of transactions made my clients/customers.

I try to model & encourage positive behaviour by creating opportunities for meaningful interactions. I use multiple methods of teaching (linguistic, visual, auditory, kinesthetic) to reach students so that no one is left behind. I use both direct & indirect ways to assess students. Direct measures may include homework, quizzes, exams, reports, essays & rubrics for oral and other performances. Indirect measures include course evaluations, student surveys & extra curriculars. Majorly my focus is on four aspects : knowledge acquired, skill development, value clarification & performance attainment. Along with unconventional teaching strategies, I respond quickly to an upset child or mediating issues between two or more children so that undesirable behaviour does not escalate. Co-curricular activities are meant to bring social skills, intellectual skills, moral values, personality progress & character appeal in students. I actively indulge in making fun plans for students like short trips around the city & help organizing school events."}]}
